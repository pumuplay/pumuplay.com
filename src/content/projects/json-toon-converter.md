The JSON-TOON Converter is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the conversion between standard JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation).

## What is TOON?

TOON is a lightweight, structured data format optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to reduce token usage while maintaining human readability and data structure integrity, making it ideal for prompt engineering and AI agent communications.

## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Conversion**: Seamlessly convert JSON to TOON and TOON to JSON.
- **Token Optimization**: Reduce the token count of your data payloads for cheaper and faster LLM processing.
- **Web Interface**: A clean, user-friendly interface for quick, on-the-fly conversions.
